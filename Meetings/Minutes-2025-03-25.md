## Summary of MA Board Decision

- Treat SEMLA as a layered standard, with a release process decoupled from major standards
- Current Proposal: Treat SEMLA as one of (several) "MA common standards"
- Proposal: Have this under the umbrella of MAP-COORD with independent working groups underneath
  - SEMLA is one such working group, led by Hubertus T.
- Details to be hashed out in a special Board meeting on technical coordination
- For this and other layered standards: make sure clear name space definition, as for FMI/SSP layered standards, with SEMLA under the org.modelica namespace.
- If Modelica annotations are desired/needed, define n MAP-LANG
- Furter progress possibly during MAP-COORD meeting in Link√∂ping 2025-3-26
