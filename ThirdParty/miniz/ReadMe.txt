Miniz
=====

Miniz is a lossless, high performance data compression library in a single source file that 
implements the zlib (RFC 1950) and Deflate (RFC 1951) compressed data format specification standards.

It's completely free: Public domain in jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, with a license 
patterned after the public domain SQLite project, see unlicense.org.

It can be downloaded from:
https://code.google.com/p/miniz/

It contains only one c-file so you only need to include this with "#include "../../ThirdParty/miniz/miniz.c"
in the source file where you want to use it.
